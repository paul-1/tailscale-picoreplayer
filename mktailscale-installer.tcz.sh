Tags:           VPN NETWORK SECURITY CLI tailscale installer
Comments:       Tailscale is a mesh VPN built on WireGuard. This extension
                downloads the current stable release for this machine's
                architecture and packages it as tailscale.tcz.

                Run it as tc, not root:
                  tailscale-installer
                  tce-load -i tailscale
                  sudo tailscale up

                Re-run tailscale-installer to upgrade.
